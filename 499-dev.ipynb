      "Apocalypse Now has one of the most haunting endings in cinema, a poetic evocation of what Kurtz has discovered, and what we hope not to discover for ourselves. The river journey creates enormous anticipation about Kurtz, and Brando fulfills it. When Apocalypse Now was released in 1979, his casting was criticized and his enormous paycheck of $1 million was much discussed, but it's clear he was the correct choice, not only because of his stature as an icon, but because of his voice, which enters Apocalypse Now from darkness or half-light, repeating the words of T.S. Eliot's despairing \"The Hollow Men.\" That voice sets the final tone of Apocalypse Now.\n",
      "There have been a lot of movies where stars have repeated the triumphs of their parts - but has any star ever done it more triumphantly than Marlon Brando does in \"The Freshman\"? He is doing a reprise here of his most popular character, Don Vito Corleone of \"The Godfather,\" and he does it with such wit, discipline and seriousness that it's not a ripoff and it's not a cheap shot, it's a brilliant comic masterstroke.\n",

Jim has a relationship, at a distance, with a young Asian boy who lives outside the prison fence, and this friendship ends in a scene that is painfully calculated and manipulative. There is another moment, at about the same time in Empire of the Sun, where Jim creeps outside the camp by hiding in a drainage canal and escapes capture and instant death not because of his wits but because Spielberg forces a camera angle - placing his camera so that a person cannot be seen who would be visible in real life. And there is the inevitable moment when the boy is associated with a huge telephoto image of the sun, and we respond not to the shot but to the memory that Spielberg loves huge celestial orbs so passionately that Jim isn't having a spontaneous moment, he's paying homage to the sun of \"The Color Purple\" and the moon of \"E.T.

      "His attacks on Steven Spielberg are painful and unfair. Some of the fragments of his film involve a Spielberg company trying to buy the memories of Holocaust survivors for a Hollywood film (it will star, we learn, Juliette Binoche, who appeared in \"Hail Mary\" but has now apparently gone over to the dark side). Elsewhere in In Praise of Love he accuses Spielberg of having made millions from \"Schindler's List\" while Mrs. Schindler lives in Argentina in poverty. One muses: (1) Has Godard, having also used her, sent her any money? (2) Has Godard or any other director living or dead done more than Spielberg, with his Holocaust Project, to honor and preserve the memories of the survivors? (3) Has Godard so lost the ability to go to In Praise of Loves that, having once loved the works of Samuel Fuller and Nicholas Ray, he cannot view a Spielberg film except through a prism of anger? Critics are often asked if they ever change their minds about a movie. I hope we can grow and learn. I do not \"review\" films seen at festivals, but \"report\" on them--because in the hothouse atmosphere of seeing three to five films a day, most of them important, one cannot always step back and catch a breath. At Cannes I saw the surface of \"In Praise of Love,\" remembered Godard's early work, and was cheered by In Praise of Love. After a second viewing, looking beneath the surface, I see so little there: It is all remembered rote work, used to conceal old tricks, facile name-calling, the loss of hope, and emptiness.\n",

Thirsting for revenge after being exiled into earth orbit, Evil wants to travel through time to when Powers was cryogenically frozen, and steal his mojo. (In case you were wondering, a beaker of mojo looks like Kool-Aid with licorice ropes floating in it.) I didn't use a stopwatch, but my guess is that Evil has more screen time than Austin this time. There are several revelations. Early in Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me, in a funny sequence set on \"The Jerry Springer Show,\" Dr. Evil's son Scott (Seth Green) appears, complaining that he hates his dad. Later a secret of parentage is revealed, \"Star Wars\"-style. And Evil acquires a midget double named Mini-Me, played by Verne Troyer and inspired, Myers has said, by the miniature Marlon Brando in \"The Island of Dr. Moreau.\" In a film with a lot of babes, Heather Graham plays the lead babe, Felicity Shagwell, a spy dedicated to her craft. In one scene that had the audience cringing when they should have been laughing, she goes to bed with a villain from Scotland named Fat Bastard, who wears a kilt, \"weighs a metric ton,\" and is covered with greasy chicken bits. (Study the end credits for a surprise about the actor playing the F.B.) There were some laughs (but more groans) during a scene where Austin mistakes a fecal brew for coffee; Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me is going for the kind of gross-out humor that distinguished \"There's Something About Mary,\" but what this sequence proves is that the grosser a scene is, the funnier it has to be to get away with it. I saw Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me with an audience recruited from the radio audience of Mancow Muller, Chicago's most cheerful vulgarian, and if they had a mixed reaction, middle America is likely to flee from the theaters.\n",

      "So persuasive are these Indiana scenes that, despite A History of Violences opening moments, we wonder if Cronenberg has abandoned his own history of violence and decided to make a small-town slice of life: A Capra picture, perhaps, with Viggo Mortensen as Jimmy Stewart. Then all hell breaks loose. Two tough guys enter the diner to try a stickup. They have guns, mean business, threaten the customers and a waitress. Moving so quickly he seems to have been practicing the scene as choreography, Tom Stall takes out the two guys and ends up on the local front pages as a hero.\n",
      "So the underlying strength of the story is there. Unfortunately, the casting and some of the romantic scenes sabotage it. Liev Schreiber is a good actor, and I have admired him in many movies, but put him beside Viggo Mortensen and the Blouse Man wins; you can hardly blame Pearl for surrendering. (I am reminded of a TV news interview about that movie where Demi Moore was offered $1 million to sleep with Robert Redford. \"Would you sleep with Robert Redford for a million dollars?'' a woman in a mall was asked. She replied: \"I'd sleep with him for 50 cents.'') A Walk on the Moon's problem is that it loads the casting in a way that tilts A Walk on the Moon in the direction of a Harlequin romance. Mortensen looks like one of those long-haired, bare-chested, muscular buccaneers on the covers of the paperbacks; all he needs is a gothic tower behind him, with one light in a window. A Walk on the Moon exhibits almost unseemly haste in speeding Pearl and the Blouse Man toward lovemaking, and then lingers over their sex scenes as if they were an end in themselves, and not a transgression in a larger story. As Pearl and the Blouse Man cavort naked under a waterfall, A Walk on the Moon forgets its ethical questions and becomes soft-core lust.\n",
      "However, Anne Heche, as Marion Crane, lacks the carnal quality and the calculating detachment that Janet Leigh brought to the original film. She is less substantial. Van Sant's decision to shoot in color instead of black and white completes the process of de-eroticizing her; she wears an orange dress that looks like the upholstery from my grandmother's wing chair. Viggo Mortensen is also wrong for Sam Loomis, the lover. Instead of suggesting a straight arrow like John Gavin in the original film, he brings an undertow of elusive weirdness. The only new cast members who more or less get the job done are William H. Macy as the private eye Arbogast, and Philip Baker Hall as Sheriff Chambers. By having a psychiatrist (Robert Forster) reproduce a five-minute speech of clinical diagnosis at the end of Psycho, Van Sant demonstrates that a completely unnecessary scene in the original, if reproduced, will be completely unnecessary in the remake as well.\n"

      "Stanley Kubrick considered \"The Killing\" (1956) to be his first mature feature, after a couple of short warm-ups. He was 28 when it was released, having already been an obsessed chess player, a photographer for Look magazine and a director of \"March of Time\" newsreels. It's tempting to search here for themes and a style he would return to in his later masterpieces, but few directors seemed so determined to make every one of his films an individual, free-standing work. Seeing it without his credit, would you guess it was by Kubrick? Would you connect \"Dr. Strangelove\" with \"Barry Lyndon?\"\n",

      "If Alex DeLarge of \"A Clockwork Orange\" had become a London gangster, he might have turned out like the hero of \"Gangster No. 1.\" Gangster No. 1 encourages that connection by casting Malcolm McDowell, the original Alex, as the character grown old. Paul Bettany, who plays Young Gangster, is often photographed with his eyes glaring up from beneath lowered brows, which was the signature look Stanley Kubrick gave Alex. Another connection: Gangster No. 1 contains a beating of startling brutality, scored by a pop song played at top volume. Gangster No. 1 is inspired, as all modern London gangster movies are inspired, by the notorious Kray brothers. It isn't based on their lives or deeds, but on the aura of evil they so successfully projected; they often got their way without violence, because they seemed so capable of it. In \"Gangster No. 1,\" the crime family is led by Freddie Mays (David Thewlis), who in 1968 is a young, sleek, expensively groomed hood who runs a nightclub and surrounds himself with hard men; he's known as the Butcher of Mayfair. One day he summons Young Gangster, tosses him a roll of bills, hires him and seals his own fate.\n",

Tracy Letts, who borrows some from his recent work as Norman in \"The Dresser,\" now takes the role of Tynan, the play's main narrator. That change adds to the magisterial force of the part, even as it removes some of its prior gentleness and vulnerability afforded by David Warren. The role of Joan is now played by Susan Bennett, a veteran of the old Annoyance Theatre. Bennett also is a spunkier choice, even as she loses the authentically suave British style of her predecessor in the role, Sarah Wellington.\n",

Most of their intrigues were played out in public, in flashy settings like the Cotton Club, a Harlem nightclub that featured the nation's most talented black entertainers on stage -- playing before an all-white audience. By telling us two love stories, Coppola shows us both sides of that racial divide. He begins by introducing Dixie Dwyer (Richard Gere), a good-looking young musician who saves the life of a gangster and is immediately recruited into the hood's inner circle. There he meets the gangster's teenage girlfriend (Diane Lane), and they immediately fall in love -- but secretly, because they'll live longer that way. Then we meet Sandman Williams (Gregory Hines), a black tap dancer who dreams of appearing at the Cotton Club, and falls in love with a member of the chorus line (Lonette McKee), a mulatto who talks about her secret life among people who think she is white.\n",

      "Why has \"Apocalypse Now\" been so long bedeviled by rumors that Coppola was not happy with this ending? At Apocalypse Now's premiere at Cannes, I saw the confusion begin. Coppola originally intended to show Apocalypse Now as a 70mm roadshow with no credits (they would be printed in a booklet). But the 35mm release would need end titles. After he was finished filming on the huge set of the Kurtz compound, Coppola was required by the Philippine government to destroy it, and he photographed it being blown up. He decided to use this footage over his closing 35mm credits, even though (this is crucial) he did not intend the destruction of the compound as an alternative \"ending\" to Apocalypse Now. Alas, confusion about the endings spread from Cannes into movie folklore, and most people thought that by \"ending\" he meant all of the material involving Kurtz. In the 20th anniversary DVD release, Coppola patiently explains all of this once again.\n",

      "Why has \"Apocalypse Now\" been so long bedeviled by rumors that Coppola was not happy with this ending? At Apocalypse Now's premiere at Cannes, I saw the confusion begin. Coppola originally intended to show Apocalypse Now as a 70mm roadshow with no credits (they would be printed in a booklet). But the 35mm release would need end titles. After he was finished filming on the huge set of the Kurtz compound, Coppola was required by the Philippine government to destroy it, and he photographed it being blown up. He decided to use this footage over his closing 35mm credits, even though (this is crucial) he did not intend the destruction of the compound as an alternative \"ending\" to Apocalypse Now. Alas, confusion about the endings spread from Cannes into movie folklore, and most people thought that by \"ending\" he meant all of the material involving Kurtz. In the 20th anniversary DVD release, Coppola patiently explains all of this once again.\n",

      "There have been a lot of movies where stars have repeated the triumphs of their parts - but has any star ever done it more triumphantly than Marlon Brando does in \"The Freshman\"? Think of the criticism Brando risked, from those ready to attack him for cashing in on his most famous performance by reprising it for a comedy. Brando must have known the dangers, but he must have had confidence in himself, too - enough to go ahead anyway, and to win a considerable gamble. When Brando finished filming \"The Freshman\" last September, he attacked The Freshman in a notorious interview in the Toronto Globe and Mail, claiming it was trash and that he was retiring from acting. The other actors, perhaps aware of the chances Brando was taking, seem a little in awe of him - which is as it should be.\n",
      "However, Brando doesn't so much walk through Don Juan DeMarco as coast, in a gassy, self-indulgent performance no one else could have gotten away with. In a new book about how he makes movies, director Sidney Lumet speculates that Marlon Brando has a way of testing his directors. Brando does a scene twice, he writes, once really putting his soul into it, the second time using only technique. And there are moments so bizarre we wonder if the director actually suggested them, or whether Brando had a brainstorm, and everybody was afraid to tell him it wasn't such a hot idea. If the director fails the test, Brando walks through the rest of Don Juan DeMarco.\n",
      "And, yes, Brando is good as the old Brando. \"Reflections in a Golden Eye\" was proof that Brando is far from dead as an actor, although he may be finished as a box office draw.\n",
      "If you can take that moment and hold it in your mind with the famous scene where he assaults Stella's sister, Blanche DuBois (Vivien Leigh), you can see the freedom Brando is giving to Stanley Kowalski - and the range. Brando held nothing back, and within a few years his was the style that dominated Hollywood movie acting.\n"

      "Why he likes Beethoven is never explained, but my notion is that Alex likes Beethoven in the same way that Kubrick likes to load his sound track with familiar classical music -- to add a cute, cheap, dead-end dimension. I don't know quite how to explain my disgust at Alex (whom Kubrick likes very much, as his visual style reveals and as we shall see in a moment). No, I think Kubrick is being too modest: Alex is all his. When Kubrick shows us Alex, however, he either places him in the center of a wide-angle shot (so Alex alone has normal human dimensions,) or uses a standard lens that does not distort. Kubrick has used visuals to alter the book's point of view and to nudge us toward a kind of grudging pal-ship with Alex. But that isn't what Kubrick is saying, He actually seems to be implying something simpler and more frightening: that in a world where society is criminal, the citizen might as well be a criminal, too. Kubrick uses the wide-angle lens almost all the time when he is showing events from Alex's point of view; this encourages us to see the world as Alex does, as a crazy-house of weird people out to get him. Alex is violent because it is necessary for him to be violent in order for A Clockwork Orange to entertain in the way Kubrick intends.\n",
      "Barry Lyndon\" isn't a great entertainment in the usual way, but it's a great example of directorial vision: Kubrick saying he's going to make this material function as an illustration of the way he sees the world. Kubrick told the critic Michel Ciment he used the narrator because the novel had too much incident even for a three-hour film, but there isn't the slightest sense he's condensing. There is no other way to see Barry than the way Kubrick sees him. By placing such small characters on such a big stage, by forcing our detachment from them, Kubrick supplies a philosophical position just as clearly as if he'd put speeches in his characters' mouths.\n",
      "Stanley Kubrick himself was a perfectionist who went to obsessive lengths in order to get everything in his films to work just right. Kubrick the perfectionist left the unplanned slip in Dr. Strangelove (Restored Version), because Scott made it seem convincing, and not an accident. Yet out of these rudimentary physical props and a brilliant screenplay (which Kubrick and Terry Southern based on a novel by Peter George), Kubrick made what is arguably the best political satire of the century, a film that pulled the rug out from under the Cold War by arguing that if a ``nuclear deterrent'' destroys all life on Earth, it is hard to say exactly what it has deterred. Kubrick, whose attention to the smallest detail in every frame was obsessive, would have been aware of George C. Scott's facial gymnastics, and yet he endorsed them, and when you watch ``Strangelove'' you can see why.\n",

      "Cape Fear is impressive moviemaking, showing Scorsese as a master of a traditional Hollywood genre who is able to mold it to his own themes and obsessions. The way he sees the character of Sam Bowden is the key to why Martin Scorsese wanted to remake the 1962 thriller Cape Fear. This is the first film in a production deal Scorsese has with Universal Studios and Steven Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment, and it represents his access to budgets much larger than those he has worked with in the past. And with this new version of Max Cady, Scorsese gives us not simply a bad man, but an evil one - whose whole purpose is to show Sam Bowden he's a criminal, too. Unlike the simplistic version of this scene we have seen in a hundred thrillers, what Scorsese gives us is a villain who has been wronged, seeking to harm a hero who has sinned.\n",
      "Remarkably, writer-director Martin Scorsese is only 25 years old, and this is his first film. It is possible that with more experience and maturity Scorsese will direct more polished, finished films--but this work, completed when he was 25, contains a frankness he may have diluted by then. Scorsese is gifted at handling subtle moments, but he has some trouble with the more obvious ones. For another misplaced scene, however, Scorsese does not deserve full blame.\n",
      "Scorsese shows a sure sense for the Hollywood of that time, as in a scene where Howard, new in town, approaches the mogul L.B. Mayer at the Coconut Grove and asks to borrow two cameras for a big \"Hells' Angels\" scene. Their lives, in fact, are even a little similar: Heedless ambition and talent when young, great early success, tempestuous romances and a dark period, although with Hughes it got darker and darker, while Scorsese has emerged into the full flower of his gifts. Scorsese adds subtle continuity: Every time we see Mayer, he seems to be surrounded by the same flunkies.\n",
      "I have often thought that many of Scorsese's critics and admirers do not realize how deeply the Catholic Church of pre-Vatican II could burrow into the subconscious, or in how many ways Scorsese is a Catholic director. It is intriguing to wonder what Scorsese saw in the Hong Kong movie that inspired him to make the second remake of his career (after \"Cape Fear\"). It's strange that Jack Nicholson and Scorsese have never worked together, since they seem like a natural fit; he makes Frank Costello not a godfather, not a rat, not a blowhard, but a smart man who finally encounters a situation no one could fight free of, because he simply lacks all the necessary information.\n"

      "Now that we know Quentin Tarantino can make a movie like \"Reservoir Dogs,\" it's time for him to move on and make a better one. Tarantino himself is also interesting as an actor; he could play great crazy villains. Reservoir Dogs feels like it's going to be terrific, but Tarantino's script doesn't have much curiosity about these guys. Having created the characters and fashioned the outline, Tarantino doesn't do much with his characters except to let them talk too much, especially when they should be unconscious from shock and loss of blood.\n",
      "But this is all one film, and now that we see it whole, it's greater than its two parts; Tarantino remains the most brilliantly oddball filmmaker of his generation, and this is one of the best films of the year. Put the two parts together, and Tarantino has made a masterful saga that celebrates the martial arts genre while kidding it, loving it, and transcending it. Kill Bill, Volume 2 is a distillation of the countless grind house kung-fu movies Tarantino has absorbed, and which he loves beyond all reason. Tarantino, who began Kill Bill, Volume 2 in black and white before switching to color, plays with formats here, too; to suggest the claustrophobia of being buried, he shows The Bride inside her wooden casket, and as clods of earth rain down on the lid, he switches from widescreen to the classic 4x3 screen ratio.\n",
      "Instead of waving his arms and talking brilliantly a mile a minute, Tarantino mumbles an approximation of a Southwestern accent and puts his charisma on hold. The first of many disappointments comes early in \"Destiny Turns On the Radio,\" when Quentin Tarantino appears on the screen. The disappointment is that Tarantino is not playing \"himself,\" the persona he has perfected on many talk shows and in celebrated roles in \"Reservoir Dogs,\" \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Sleep With Me\" (where he explained his theory that \"Top Gun\" was a gay movie).\n",
      "Tarantino has a lot of good scenes in Jackie Brown. This is Jackie Brown that proves Tarantino is the real thing, and not just a two-film wonder boy. Tarantino leaves the hardest questions for last, hides his moves, conceals his strategies in plain view, and gives his characters dialogue that is alive, authentic and spontaneous.\n"

Scorsese and De Niro are the most creative, productive director/actor team in The King of Comedys right now, and the fact that they feel the freedom to make such an odd, stimulating, unsatisfyng movie is good news, I guess. It's hard to believe Scorsese made it; instead of the big-city life, the violence and sexuality of his movies like \"Taxi Driver\" and \"Mean Streets,\" what we have here is an agonizing portrait of lonely, angry people with their emotions all tightly bottled up.\n",

      "Brando must have known the dangers, but he must have had confidence in himself, too - enough to go ahead anyway, and to win a considerable gamble. There have been a lot of movies where stars have repeated the triumphs of their parts - but has any star ever done it more triumphantly than Marlon Brando does in \"The Freshman\"? Think of the criticism Brando risked, from those ready to attack him for cashing in on his most famous performance by reprising it for a comedy. When Brando finished filming \"The Freshman\" last September, he attacked The Freshman in a notorious interview in the Toronto Globe and Mail, claiming it was trash and that he was retiring from acting. The other actors, perhaps aware of the chances Brando was taking, seem a little in awe of him - which is as it should be.\n",
      "Brando even tested for the role, but he fell out, Bergman was troubled in her controversial marriage to Roberto Rossellini, and Count Luchino Visconti settled for Valli, an important European star, and Granger, a lesser but well-known star from America. Brando was an imposing masculine presence, and Mahler needs to be a faithless coward.\n",
      "And, yes, Brando is good as the old Brando. \"Reflections in a Golden Eye\" was proof that Brando is far from dead as an actor, although he may be finished as a box office draw. But Brando has not done any acting in the last ten years to equal his magnificent performance in \"Reflections in a Golden Eye\" (1967) a box office flop. But the question remains: Should Brando really be wasting his time on this sort of movie? Miss Moreno has a difficult scene with Brando (she's on dope and keeps going to sleep in a bathtub) that she handles with quiet conviction.\n",
      "However, In a new book about how he makes movies, director Sidney Lumet speculates that Marlon Brando has a way of testing his directors. If the director fails the test, Brando walks through the rest of Don Juan DeMarco. Brando doesn't so much walk through Don Juan DeMarco as coast, in a gassy, self-indulgent performance no one else could have gotten away with. Brando does a scene twice, he writes, once really putting his soul into it, the second time using only technique. And there are moments so bizarre we wonder if the director actually suggested them, or whether Brando had a brainstorm, and everybody was afraid to tell him it wasn't such a hot idea.\n"

The parallels between Coppola and Tucker are so obvious that its surprising Coppola didnt observe one more: He has been as protective of Tuckers private life as he rightly is of his own.

    "- Thesis statement is about the desired subject (person in this case)\n",
    "- If the person is an actor/actress, the sentences are about the person, not a character\n",

    "We know that sentences in the beginning and ends of paragraphs (and likely even articles e.g. intros/conclusions) tend to work well.

    "- ROUGE-W: Weighted LCS-based statistics that favors consecutive LCSes .\n",
    "- ROUGE-S: Skip-bigram[5] based co-occurrence statistics. Skip-bigram is any pair of words in their sentence order.\n",

    "Brando must have known the dangers, but he must have had confidence in himself, too - enough to go ahead anyway, and to win a considerable gamble. There have been a lot of movies where stars have repeated the triumphs of their parts - but has any star ever done it more triumphantly than Marlon Brando does in \"The Freshman\"? Think of the criticism Brando risked, from those ready to attack him for cashing in on his most famous performance by reprising it for a comedy. When Brando finished filming \"The Freshman\" last September, he attacked The Freshman in a notorious interview in the Toronto Globe and Mail, claiming it was trash and that he was retiring from acting. The other actors, perhaps aware of the chances Brando was taking, seem a little in awe of him - which is as it should be.\n",
    "Brando even tested for the role, but he fell out, Bergman was troubled in her controversial marriage to Roberto Rossellini, and Count Luchino Visconti settled for Valli, an important European star, and Granger, a lesser but well-known star from America. Brando was an imposing masculine presence, and Mahler needs to be a faithless coward.\n",
    "And, yes, Brando is good as the old Brando. \"Reflections in a Golden Eye\" was proof that Brando is far from dead as an actor, although he may be finished as a box office draw. But Brando has not done any acting in the last ten years to equal his magnificent performance in \"Reflections in a Golden Eye\" (1967) a box office flop. But the question remains: Should Brando really be wasting his time on this sort of movie? Miss Moreno has a difficult scene with Brando (she's on dope and keeps going to sleep in a bathtub) that she handles with quiet conviction.\n",
    "However, In a new book about how he makes movies, director Sidney Lumet speculates that Marlon Brando has a way of testing his directors. If the director fails the test, Brando walks through the rest of Don Juan DeMarco. Brando doesn't so much walk through Don Juan DeMarco as coast, in a gassy, self-indulgent performance no one else could have gotten away with. Brando does a scene twice, he writes, once really putting his soul into it, the second time using only technique. And there are moments so bizarre we wonder if the director actually suggested them, or whether Brando had a brainstorm, and everybody was afraid to tell him it wasn't such a hot idea.\n",

    "Francis Ford Coppola's film \"Apocalypse Now\" was inspired by Heart of Darkness, a novel by Joseph Conrad about a European named Kurtz who penetrated to the farthest reaches of the Congo and established himself like a god. A boat sets out to find him, and on the journey the narrator gradually loses confidence in orderly civilization; he is oppressed by the great weight of the jungle all around him, a pitiless Darwinian testing ground in which each living thing tries every day not to be eaten.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is found at the end of the journey is not Kurtz so much as what Kurtz found: that all of our days and ways are a fragile structure perched uneasily atop the hungry jaws of nature that will thoughtlessly devour us. A happy life is a daily reprieve from this knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "A week ago I was in Calcutta, where I saw mile upon square mile of squatter camps in which hundreds of thousands live generation after generation in leaky huts of plastic, cardboard and scrap metal, in poverty so absolute it is impossible to see any hope of escape. I do not mean to equate the misery of those hopeless people with a movie; that would be indecent. But I was deeply shaken by what I saw, and realized how precious and precarious is a happy life. And in such a mood I watched \"Apocalypse Now\" and came to the scene where Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) tells Capt. Willard (Martin Sheen) about \"the horror.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Kurtz is a decorated hero, one of the best soldiers in the Army, who has created a jungle sanctuary upriver inside enemy territory, and rules Montagnard tribesmen as his private army. He tells Willard about a day when his Special Forces men inoculated the children of a village against polio: \"This old man came running after us and he was crying, he couldn't see. We went back there, and they had come and hacked off every inoculated arm. There they were in a pile, a pile of little arms. . . .\"\n",
    "\n",
    "What Kurtz learned is that the Viet Cong were willing to go to greater lengths to win: \"Then I realized they were stronger than we. They have the strength, the strength to do that. If I had 10 divisions of those men, then our troubles here would be over very quickly. You have to have men who are moral and at the same time who are able to utilize their primordial instincts to kill without feeling, without passion, without judgment.\" This is the \"horror\" that Kurtz has found, and it threatens to envelop Willard, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole movie is a journey toward Willard's understanding of how Kurtz, one of the Army's best soldiers, penetrated the reality of war to such a depth that he could not look any longer without madness and despair.\n",
    "\n",
    "The film has one of the most haunting endings in cinema, a poetic evocation of what Kurtz has discovered, and what we hope not to discover for ourselves. The river journey creates enormous anticipation about Kurtz, and Brando fulfills it. When the film was released in 1979, his casting was criticized and his enormous paycheck of $1 million was much discussed, but it's clear he was the correct choice, not only because of his stature as an icon, but because of his voice, which enters the film from darkness or half-light, repeating the words of T.S. Eliot's despairing \"The Hollow Men.\" That voice sets the final tone of the film.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another crucial element in the ending is the photojournalist (Dennis Hopper) who has somehow found Kurtz's camp and stayed there, stoned, as a witness. He blathers to Willard that Kurtz is \"a poet-warrior in the classic sense\" and \"we're all his children.\" In the photographer's spaced-out ravings we hear disconnected snatches of the poetry he must have heard Kurtz reciting: If you can keep your head when all about you . . . I should have been a pair of ragged claws, scuttling across the floor of a silent sea. . . .\" The photographer is the guide, the clown, the fool, providing the balance between Willard and Kurtz.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why has \"Apocalypse Now\" been so long bedeviled by rumors that Coppola was not happy with this ending? At the film's premiere at Cannes, I saw the confusion begin. Coppola originally intended to show the movie as a 70mm roadshow with no credits (they would be printed in a booklet). But the 35mm release would need end titles. After he was finished filming on the huge set of the Kurtz compound, Coppola was required by the Philippine government to destroy it, and he photographed it being blown up. He decided to use this footage over his closing 35mm credits, even though (this is crucial) he did not intend the destruction of the compound as an alternative \"ending\" to the film. Alas, confusion about the endings spread from Cannes into movie folklore, and most people thought that by \"ending\" he meant all of the material involving Kurtz. In the 20th anniversary DVD release, Coppola patiently explains all of this once again.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any event, seen again now at a distance of 20 years, \"Apocalypse Now\" is more clearly than ever one of the key films of the century. Most films are lucky to contain a single great sequence. \"Apocalypse Now\" strings together one after another, with the river journey as the connecting link. The best is the helicopter attack on a Vietnam village, led by Col. Kilgore (Robert Duvall), whose choppers use loudspeakers at top volume to play Wagner's \"Ride of the Valkyries\" as they swoop down on a yard full of schoolchildren. Duvall won an Oscar nomination for his performance and its unforgettable line, \"I love the smell of napalm in the morning.\" His emptiness is frightening: A surfing fanatic, he agrees to the attack only to liberate a beach said to offer great waves (\"Charlie don't surf\").\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also the sequence where the patrol boat stops a small fishing boat with a family on board. A little girl makes a sudden dash, and the jumpy machine-gunner (a young Laurence Fishburne) opens fire, wiping out the entire family. It turns out the girl was running for her puppy. The mother is not quite dead. The boat chief (Albert Hall) wants to take her for medical treatment. Willard puts a bullet into her; nothing can delay his mission. He and \"Chief\" are the only two seasoned military men on the boat, trying to do things by the book; later, in a scene with peculiar power, the chief is astonished to be killed by a spear.\n",
    "\n",
    "For me the most remarkable visuals in the film occur when Chef (Fredric Forrest), one of Willard's crew members, insists on venturing into the forest in search of mangos. Willard can't stop him, so he joins him. The great cinematographer Vittorio Storaro shows them as little human specks at the foot of towering trees, and this is a Joseph Conrad moment, showing how nature dwarfs us.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rock 'n' roll soundtrack opens and closes with \"The End\" by the Doors, and includes disc jockeys on transistor radios (\"Good morning, Vietnam!\"). The music underlines surrealistic moments, as when Lance (Sam Bottoms), one of Willard's crew, water-skis behind the boat. It also shows how the soldiers try to use the music of home, and booze and drugs, to ease their loneliness and apprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other important films such as \"Platoon,\" \"The Deer Hunter,\" \"Full Metal Jacket\" and \"Casualties of War\" take their own approaches to Vietnam. Once at the Hawaii Film Festival I saw five North Vietnamese films about the war. (They never mentioned \"America,\" only \"the enemy,\" and one director told me, \"It is all the same--we have been invaded by China, France, the U.S. . . .\") But \"Apocalypse Now\" is the best Vietnam film, one of the greatest of all films, because it pushes beyond the others, into the dark places of the soul. It is not about war so much as about how war reveals truths we would be happy never to discover.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a way I cannot quite explain, my thoughts since Calcutta prepared me to understand the horror that Kurtz found. If we are lucky, we spend our lives in a fool's paradise, never knowing how close we skirt the abyss. What drives Kurtz mad is his discovery of this.\n",

    "“The Godfather” is told entirely within a closed world. That’s why we sympathize with characters who are essentially evil. The story by Mario Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola is a brilliant conjuring act, inviting us to consider the Mafia entirely on its own terms. Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) emerges as a sympathetic and even admirable character; during the entire film, this lifelong professional criminal does nothing of which we can really disapprove.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the movie we see not a single actual civilian victim of organized crime. No women trapped into prostitution. No lives wrecked by gambling. No victims of theft, fraud or protection rackets. The only police officer with a significant speaking role is corrupt.\n",
    "\n",
    "The story views the Mafia from the inside. That is its secret, its charm, its spell; in a way, it has shaped the public perception of the Mafia ever since. The real world is replaced by an authoritarian patriarchy where power and justice flow from the Godfather, and the only villains are traitors. There is one commandment, spoken by Michael (Al Pacino): “Don’t ever take sides against the family.”\n",
    "\n",
    "It is significant that the first shot is inside a dark, shuttered room. It is the wedding day of Vito Corleone’s daughter, and on such a day a Sicilian must grant any reasonable request. A man has come to ask for punishment for his daughter’s rapist. Don Vito asks why he did not come to him immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "“I went to the police, like a good American,” the man says. The Godfather’s reply will underpin the entire movie: “Why did you go to the police? Why didn’t you come to me first? What have I ever done to make you treat me so disrespectfully? If you’d come to me in friendship, then this scum that ruined your daughter would be suffering this very day. And if, by chance, an honest man like yourself should make enemies . . . then they would become my enemies. And then they would fear you.”\n",
    "\n",
    "As the day continues, there are two more scenes in the Godfather’s darkened study, intercut with scenes from the wedding outside. By the end of the wedding sequence, most of the main characters will have been introduced, and we will know essential things about their personalities. It is a virtuoso stretch of filmmaking: Coppola brings his large cast onstage so artfully that we are drawn at once into the Godfather’s world.\n",
    "\n",
    "The screenplay of “The Godfather” follows no formulas except for the classic structure in which power passes between the generations. The writing is subtly constructed to set up events later in the film. Notice how the request by Johnny Fontane, the failing singer, pays off in the Hollywood scenes; how his tears set up the shocking moment when a mogul wakes up in bed with what is left of his racehorse. Notice how the undertaker is told “someday, and that day may never come, I will ask a favor of you. . .” and how when the day comes the favor is not violence (as in a conventional movie) but Don Vito’s desire to spare his wife the sight of their son’s maimed body. And notice how a woman’s “mistaken” phone call sets up the trap in which Sonny (James Caan) is murdered: It’s done so neatly that you have to think back through the events to figure it out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now here is a trivia question: What is the name of Vito’s wife? She exists in the movie as an insignificant shadow, a plump Sicilian grandmother who poses with her husband in wedding pictures but plays no role in the events that take place in his study. There is little room for women in “The Godfather.” Sonny uses and discards them, and ignores his wife. Connie (Talia Shire), the Don’s daughter, is so disregarded that her husband is not allowed into the family business. He is thrown a bone--”a living”--and later, when he is killed, Michael coldly lies to his sister about what happened.\n",
    "\n",
    "The irony of the title is that it eventually comes to refer to the son, not the father. As the film opens Michael is not part of the family business, and plans to marry a WASP, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). His turning point comes when he saves his father’s life by moving his hospital bed, and whispers to the unconscious man: “I’m with you now.”\n",
    "\n",
    "After he shoots the corrupt cop, Michael hides in Sicily, where he falls in love with and marries Appolonia (Simonetta Stefanelli). They do not speak the same language; small handicap for a Mafia wife. He undoubtedly loves Appolonia, as he loved Kay, but what is he thinking here: that he can no longer marry Kay because he has chosen a Mafia life? After Appolonia’s death and his return to America, he seeks out Kay and eventually they marry. Did he tell her about Appolonia? Such details are unimportant to the story.\n",
    "\n",
    "What is important is loyalty to the family. Much is said in the movie about trusting a man’s word, but honesty is nothing compared to loyalty. Michael doesn’t even trust Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) with the secret that he plans to murder the heads of the other families. The famous “baptism massacre” is tough, virtuoso filmmaking: The baptism provides him with an airtight alibi, and he becomes a godfather in both senses at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vito Corleone is the moral center of the film. He is old, wise and opposed to dealing in drugs. He understands that society is not alarmed by “liquor, gambling . . . even women.” But drugs are a dirty business to Don Vito, and one of the movie’s best scenes is the Mafia summit at which he argues his point. The implication is that in the godfather’s world there would be no drugs, only “victimless crimes,” and justice would be dispatched evenly and swiftly.\n",
    "\n",
    "My argument is taking this form because I want to point out how cleverly Coppola structures his film to create sympathy for his heroes. The Mafia is not a benevolent and protective organization, and the Corleone family is only marginally better than the others. Yet when the old man falls dead among his tomato plants, we feel that a giant has passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gordon Willis’ cinematography is celebrated for its darkness; it is rich, atmospheric, expressive. You cannot appreciate this on television because the picture is artificially brightened. Coppola populates his dark interior spaces with remarkable faces. The front-line actors--Brando, Pacino, Caan, Duvall--are attractive in one way or another, but those who play their associates are chosen for their fleshy, thickly lined faces--for huge jaws and deeply set eyes. Look at Abe Vigoda as Tessio, the fearsome enforcer. The first time we see him, he’s dancing with a child at the wedding, her satin pumps balanced on his shoes. The sun shines that day, but never again: He is developed as a hulking presence who implies the possibility of violent revenge. Only at the end is he brightly lit again, to make him look vulnerable as he begs for his life.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Brando performance is justly famous and often imitated. We know all about his puffy cheeks, and his use of props like the kitten in the opening scene. Those are actor’s devices. Brando uses them but does not depend on them: He embodies the character so convincingly that at the end, when he warns his son two or three times that “the man who comes to you to set up a meeting--that’s the traitor,” we are not thinking of acting at all. We are thinking that the Don is growing old and repeating himself, but we are also thinking that he is probably absolutely right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pacino plays Michael close to his vest; he has learned from his father never to talk in front of outsiders, never to trust anyone unnecessarily, to take advice but keep his own counsel. All of the other roles are so successfully filled that a strange thing happened as I watched this restored 1997 version: Familiar as I am with Robert Duvall, when he first appeared on the screen I found myself thinking, “There’s Tom Hagen.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Coppola went to Italy to find Nino Rota, composer of many Fellini films, to score the picture. Hearing the sadness and nostalgia of the movie’s main theme, I realized what the music was telling us: Things would have turned out better if we had only listened to the Godfather.\n",

Think of the criticism Brando risked, from those ready to attack him for cashing in on his most famous performance by reprising it for a comedy. Brando must have known the dangers, but he must have had confidence in himself, too - enough to go ahead anyway, and to win a considerable gamble. When Brando finished filming \"The Freshman\" last September, he attacked The Freshman in a notorious interview in the Toronto Globe and Mail, claiming it was trash and that he was retiring from acting. The other actors, perhaps aware of the chances Brando was taking, seem a little in awe of him - which is as it should be.\n",
    "However, Brando doesn't so much walk through Don Juan DeMarco as coast, in a gassy, self-indulgent performance no one else could have gotten away with. In a new book about how he makes movies, director Sidney Lumet speculates that Marlon Brando has a way of testing his directors. Brando does a scene twice, he writes, once really putting his soul into it, the second time using only technique. And there are moments so bizarre we wonder if the director actually suggested them, or whether Brando had a brainstorm, and everybody was afraid to tell him it wasn't such a hot idea. If the director fails the test, Brando walks through the rest of Don Juan DeMarco.\n",
    "And, yes, Brando is good as the old Brando. \"Reflections in a Golden Eye\" was proof that Brando is far from dead as an actor, although he may be finished as a box office draw.\n",
    "If you can take that moment and hold it in your mind with the famous scene where he assaults Stella's sister, Blanche DuBois (Vivien Leigh), you can see the freedom Brando is giving to Stanley Kowalski - and the range. Brando held nothing back, and within a few years his was the style that dominated Hollywood movie acting.\"\"\"\n",

It's strange that Jack Nicholson and Scorsese have never worked together, since they seem like a natural fit; he makes Frank Costello not a godfather, not a rat, not a blowhard, but a smart man who finally encounters a situation no one could fight free of, because he simply lacks all the necessary information.\"\"\"\n"

Their lives, in fact, are even a little similar: Heedless ambition and talent when young, great early success, tempestuous romances and a dark period, although with Hughes it got darker and darker, while Scorsese has emerged into the full flower of his gifts. Scorsese adds subtle continuity: Every time we see Mayer, he seems to be surrounded by the same flunkies.\n",
    "I have often thought that many of Scorsese's critics and admirers do not realize how deeply the Catholic Church of pre-Vatican II could burrow into the subconscious, or in how many ways Scorsese is a Catholic director. It is intriguing to wonder what Scorsese saw in the Hong Kong movie that inspired him to make the second remake of his career (after \"Cape Fear\"). It's strange that Jack Nicholson and Scorsese have never worked together, since they seem like a natural fit; he makes Frank Costello not a godfather, not a rat, not a blowhard, but a smart man who finally encounters a situation no one could fight free of, because he simply lacks all the necessary information.\"\"\"\n",

Tarantino himself is also interesting as an actor; he could play great crazy villains. Reservoir Dogs feels like it's going to be terrific, but Tarantino's script doesn't have much curiosity about these guys. Having created the characters and fashioned the outline, Tarantino doesn't do much with his characters except to let them talk too much, especially when they should be unconscious from shock and loss of blood.\n",
    "But this is all one film, and now that we see it whole, it's greater than its two parts; Tarantino remains the most brilliantly oddball filmmaker of his generation, and this is one of the best films of the year. Put the two parts together, and Tarantino has made a masterful saga that celebrates the martial arts genre while kidding it, loving it, and transcending it. Kill Bill, Volume 2 is a distillation of the countless grind house kung-fu movies Tarantino has absorbed, and which he loves beyond all reason. Tarantino, who began Kill Bill, Volume 2 in black and white before switching to color, plays with formats here, too; to suggest the claustrophobia of being buried, he shows The Bride inside her wooden casket, and as clods of earth rain down on the lid, he switches from widescreen to the classic 4x3 screen ratio.\n",
    "Instead of waving his arms and talking brilliantly a mile a minute, Tarantino mumbles an approximation of a Southwestern accent and puts his charisma on hold. The first of many disappointments comes early in \"Destiny Turns On the Radio,\" when Quentin Tarantino appears on the screen. The disappointment is that Tarantino is not playing \"himself,\" the persona he has perfected on many talk shows and in celebrated roles in \"Reservoir Dogs,\" \"Pulp Fiction\" and \"Sleep With Me\" (where he explained his theory that \"Top Gun\" was a gay movie).\n",
    "Tarantino has a lot of good scenes in Jackie Brown. This is Jackie Brown that proves Tarantino is the real thing, and not just a two-film wonder boy. Tarantino leaves the hardest questions for last, hides his moves, conceals his strategies in plain view, and gives his characters dialogue that is alive, authentic and spontaneous.\"\"\"\n",

    "ke = \"\"\"Why he likes Beethoven is never explained, but my notion is that Alex likes Beethoven in the same way that Kubrick likes to load his sound track with familiar classical music -- to add a cute, cheap, dead-end dimension. I don't know quite how to explain my disgust at Alex (whom Kubrick likes very much, as his visual style reveals and as we shall see in a moment). No, I think Kubrick is being too modest: Alex is all his. When Kubrick shows us Alex, however, he either places him in the center of a wide-angle shot (so Alex alone has normal human dimensions,) or uses a standard lens that does not distort. Kubrick has used visuals to alter the book's point of view and to nudge us toward a kind of grudging pal-ship with Alex. But that isn't what Kubrick is saying, He actually seems to be implying something simpler and more frightening: that in a world where society is criminal, the citizen might as well be a criminal, too. Kubrick uses the wide-angle lens almost all the time when he is showing events from Alex's point of view; this encourages us to see the world as Alex does, as a crazy-house of weird people out to get him. Alex is violent because it is necessary for him to be violent in order for A Clockwork Orange to entertain in the way Kubrick intends.\n",
    "Barry Lyndon\" isn't a great entertainment in the usual way, but it's a great example of directorial vision: Kubrick saying he's going to make this material function as an illustration of the way he sees the world. Kubrick told the critic Michel Ciment he used the narrator because the novel had too much incident even for a three-hour film, but there isn't the slightest sense he's condensing. There is no other way to see Barry than the way Kubrick sees him. By placing such small characters on such a big stage, by forcing our detachment from them, Kubrick supplies a philosophical position just as clearly as if he'd put speeches in his characters' mouths.\n",
    "Stanley Kubrick himself was a perfectionist who went to obsessive lengths in order to get everything in his films to work just right. Kubrick the perfectionist left the unplanned slip in Dr. Strangelove (Restored Version), because Scott made it seem convincing, and not an accident. Yet out of these rudimentary physical props and a brilliant screenplay (which Kubrick and Terry Southern based on a novel by Peter George), Kubrick made what is arguably the best political satire of the century, a film that pulled the rug out from under the Cold War by arguing that if a ``nuclear deterrent'' destroys all life on Earth, it is hard to say exactly what it has deterred. Kubrick, whose attention to the smallest detail in every frame was obsessive, would have been aware of George C. Scott's facial gymnastics, and yet he endorsed them, and when you watch ``Strangelove'' you can see why.\n",

    "The success of “The Godfather” as a novel was largely due to a series of unforgettable scenes. Puzo is a good storyteller, but no great shakes as a writer. The movie gives almost everything in the novel except the gynecological repair job. It doesn’t miss a single killing; it opens with the wedding of Don Corleone’s daughter (and attendant upstairs activity); and there are the right number of auto bombs, double crosses, and garrotings.\n",
    "Coppola has found a style and a visual look for all this material so “The Godfather” becomes something of a rarity: a really good movie squeezed from a bestseller. The decision to shoot everything in period decor (the middle and late 1940s) was crucial; if they’d tried to save money as they originally planned, by bringing everything up-to-date, the movie simply wouldn’t have worked. But it’s uncannily successful as a period piece, filled with sleek, bulging limousines and postwar fedoras. Coppola and his cinematographer, Gordon Willis, also do some interesting things with the color photography. The earlier scenes have a reddish-brown tint, slightly overexposed and feeling like nothing so much as a 1946 newspaper rotogravure supplement.\n",
    "Although the movie is three hours long, it absorbs us so effectively it never has to hurry. There is something in the measured passage of time as Don Corleone hands over his reins of power that would have made a shorter, faster moving film unseemly. Even at this length, there are characters in relationships you can’t quite understand unless you’ve read the novel. Or perhaps you can, just by the way the characters look at each other.\n",

      "It may seem surprising to say that Baker holds the screen against Jack Nicholson, and yet she does. Nicholsons homecoming is all the more effective because Carroll Baker is so good as his wife, who has never remarried, who in her way does not blame him for what he has made of their lives, because he had his reasons. Nicholson and Streep play drunks in Ironweed, and actors are said to like to play drunks, because it gives them an excuse for overacting. As the drunk, hallucinatory Nicholson sees the face of a trolley driver he accidentally killed years ago, we begin to understand some of the chaos within his soaked brain.\n",
      "Nicholson is so proud of the bridge that he essentially forgets about the war. The next morning brings an elaborate interplay of characters and motives, as the sound of the approaching train creates suspense, while Nicholson, incredibly, seems ready to expose the sabotage rather than see his beloved bridge go down. But he is a rigidly dutiful officer, and we see him weeping privately with humiliation because Nicholson is a better bridge builder; he prepares for hara-kiri if the bridge is not ready on time.\n",
      "The story: Rachel meets Mark and it's love at first sight, but it's not the kind of loin-churning passion we felt when Nicholson met Kathleen Turner in \"Prizzi's Honor.\" It's more of a low-grade fever, something to be treated with aspirin - or marriage. There are scenes set in the thickets of Washington gossip, where Catherine O'Hara plays the reigning bitch goddess, and other scenes of domesticity, as when Nicholson wonders why the carpenters have not supplied a doorway from the kitchen to the rest of the house. And a moment when Nicholson sits by her bed and cries, because he knows that the flaws in his character will make it impossible for him to function responsibly as a husband and father.\n",

      "Too bad, because in their best scenes together, Nicholson and Mohr achieve a kind of intimacy and immediate truth that is hard to find, and a shame to waste. They aren't sitcom types, but solid, loyal, comfortable, smart people; Alice reminds me a little of Nicholson's great performance in \"Tully\" (2000) as a veterinary student who knows who she wants to marry and captures her prey with infinite subtlety and tenderness.\n",

      "Historic moments in the cinema are not always this easy to identify: Nicholson had been in movies for years, but his jailhouse dialogue in \"Easy Rider\" instantly made him a star. In scenes like the one where Hopper and Fonda teach Nicholson how to inhale, there's a quietly approving air, as if life is a treatable disease, and pot is the cure. Easy Rider comes alive with the electrifying entry of the Jack Nicholson character, a lawyer named George Hanson whom they meet in a jail cell.\n",
      "Joe Don Baker and Pierce Brosnan are the exceptions; many of the other actors don't seem in on the joke, and Nicholson doesn't look like he's having a good time. The action also takes place in Las Vegas, where Nicholson, in an unsuccessful and unnecessary dual role, plays a casino owner with a boozy wife (Annette Bening).\n",

       "'1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.\\n2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.\\n3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.\\n--Isaac Asimov\\'s I, Robot\\n\\'I, Robot\" takes place in Chicago circa 2035, a city where spectacular new skyscrapers share the skyline with landmarks like the Sears (but not the Trump) Tower. The tallest of the buildings belongs to U.S. Robotics, and on the floor of its atrium lobby lies the dead body of its chief robot designer, apparently a suicide.\\nDet. Del Spooner is on the case. Will Smith plays Spooner, a Chicago Police Department detective who doesn\\'t think it\\'s suicide. He has a deep-seated mistrust of robots, despite the famous Three Laws of Robotics, which declare above all that a robot must not harm a human being.\\nThe dead man is Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), who, we are told, wrote the Three Laws. Every schoolchild knows the laws were set down by the good doctor Isaac Asimov, after a conversation he had on Dec. 23, 1940, with John W. Campbell, the legendary editor of Astounding Science Fiction. It is peculiar that no one in the film knows that, especially since the film is \"based on the book by Isaac Asimov.\" Would it have killed the filmmakers to credit Asimov?\\nAsimov\\'s robot stories were often based on robots that got themselves hopelessly entangled in logical contradictions involving the laws. According to the invaluable Wikipedia encyclopedia on the Web, Harlan Ellison and Asimov collaborated in the 1970s on an \"I, Robot\" screenplay, which, the good doctor said, would produce \"the first really adult, complex, worthwhile science fiction movie ever made.\"\\nWhile that does not speak highly for \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" (1968), it is certain that the screenplay for this film, by Jeff Vintar and Akiva Goldsman, is not adult, complex or worthwhile, although it is indeed science fiction. The director is Alex Proyas, whose great \"Dark City\" (1998) was also about a hero trying to make sense of the deceptive natures of the beings around him.\\nThe movie makes Spooner into another one of those movie cops who insults the powerful, races recklessly around town, gets his badge pulled by his captain, solves the crime and survives incredible physical adventures. In many of these exploits he is accompanied by Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan), whose job at U.S. Robotics is \"to make the robots seem more human.\"\\nAt this she is not very successful. The movie\\'s robots are curiously uninvolving as individuals, and when seen by the hundreds or thousands look like shiny chromium ants. True, a robot need not have much of a personality, but there is one robot, named Sonny and voiced by Alan Tudyk, who is more advanced than the standard robot, more \"human,\" and capable of questions like \"What am I?\" -- a question many movie characters might profitably ask themselves.\\nIf Sonny doesn\\'t have real feelings, he comes as close to them as any of the humans in the movie. Both Spooner and Calvin are kept in motion so relentlessly that their human sides get overlooked, except for a touching story Spooner tells about how a little girl dies because a robot was too logical. Sonny doesn\\'t seem as \"human\" as, say, Andrew, the robot played by Robin Williams in \"Bicentennial Man\" (1999), based on a robot story by Asimov and Robert Silverberg. But his voice has a certain poignancy, and suggests some the chilly chumminess of HAL 9000.\\nThe plot I will not detail, except to note that you already know from the ads that the robots are up to no good, and Spooner could write a lot of tickets for Three Laws violations.\\nThe plot is simple-minded and disappointing, and the chase and action scenes are pretty much routine for movies in the sci-fi CGI genre. The robots never seem to have the heft and weight of actual metallic machines, and make boring villains.\\nDr. Susan Calvin is one of those handy movie characters who knows all the secrets, can get through all the doors, can solve all the problems and helps Spooner move almost at will through the Robotics skyscraper, which seems curiously ill-guarded. When they team up against the eventual villain, it\\'s an obvious ploy to create yet another space where characters can fall for hundreds of feet and somehow save themselves.\\nAs for the robots, they function like the giant insects in \"Starship Troopers,\" as video game targets. You can\\'t even be mad at them, since they\\'re only programs. Although, come to think of it, you can be mad at programs; Microsoft Word has inspired me to rage far beyond anything these robots engender.'"
